# Path finding Algorithm Project

I am using UCS, IDS and A* search algorithms. The graph is a NxN where N = 2n - 1, n is the input from the user and is the 
number of the nodes in a row.
I implement the visualization with pygame and for the algorithms, I use PriorityQueue and dictionaries.

How to use the program.

- type  the size of nodes you want (N) the input accepts 3-50.
- type the percentage of random edges you want to get removed.
- then depending on the algorithm you want to run press U for UCS, I for IDS, A for A*.
- to reset the graph press SPACE.
